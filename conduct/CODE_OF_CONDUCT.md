# ✨ Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 💪 Our Commitment

We — as contributors, maintainers, members, and organisation owners — **commit to making this community a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free space** for everyone. That means **everyone**: regardless of age, appearance, disability (visible or not), gender identity or expression, experience level, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or socio-economic background.

We are especially committed to uplifting those historically underrepresented in tech and science — including **women, LGBTQIA+ folks, people of color, people with disabilities, and early-career researchers**.

We pledge to:

🌈 Foster an open, welcoming, diverse, and kind community  
🤝 Collaborate with empathy and humility  
🚫 Stand firmly against discrimination, harassment, and exclusionary behavior  
🌱 Create a space where people can learn, grow, and thrive together  

---

## 🤝 Inclusive Behavior

We welcome and encourage:

- 🗣️ Respectful and inclusive language  
- 💖 Empathy and kindness toward all community members  
- 🛠️ Constructive feedback given with care  
- 🧠 Acknowledging and learning from mistakes  
- 🌍 Encouraging diverse voices and perspectives  
- 🙋 Asking for and offering help thoughtfully  
- 🚀 Supporting newcomers and lifelong learners

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors **will not be tolerated**:

- Harassment of any kind (online or offline), including:  
  - Offensive or derogatory comments related to gender, sexuality, race, religion, disability, or identity  
  - Sexualized language, images, or unwanted attention  
  - Deliberate misgendering or deadnaming  
  - Intimidation, stalking, or persistent disruption  
- Talking over, dismissing, or ridiculing people—especially targeting those who are junior, less experienced, or from underrepresented groups. Such behavior is a clear abuse of power and undermines our mission of inclusion and respect.  
- Stereotyping someone’s skills, knowledge, or interests  
- Gatekeeping or elitism  
- Retaliation against anyone reporting an issue

## ⚖️ Power Dynamics

We recognize power imbalances exist — from leadership roles, experience, or expertise. In our multidisciplinary community, all contributions matter, whether in coding, physics, astronomy, communication, or infrastructure.

Leaders and mentors must set the highest standards for respect, inclusion, and support. Abuse of power in tone, language, gatekeeping, or decisions **undermines our mission**.

We deeply value and support junior and early-career members. No one should feel dismissed or underestimated because of their experience. Everyone’s growth and expertise are essential and respected.

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report immediately to:

We treat all reports with discretion and seriousness. We will:

- Investigate fairly and promptly  
- Prioritize safety and privacy  
- Take corrective action up to permanent exclusion  

Retaliation against reporters or helpers **will not be tolerated**.
