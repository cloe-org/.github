# ✨ Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 💪 Our Commitment

We — contributors, maintainers, members, and organization owners — **commit to making this community a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free space** for everyone. That means **everyone**: regardless of age, appearance, disability (visible or not), gender identity or expression, experience level, nationality, race, religion, political and/or sexual orientation, or socio-economic background.

We are especially committed to uplifting those historically underrepresented in tech and science — including **women, LGBTQIA+ people, people of color, people with disabilities, and early-career scientists**.

We pledge to:

🌈 Foster an open, welcoming, diverse, and kind community  
🤝 Collaborate with empathy and humility  
🧭 Communicate with integrity and purpose  
🚫 Stand firmly against discrimination, harassment, and exclusionary behavior  
🌱 Create a space where people can learn, grow, and thrive together

## 🗣️ Thoughtful Communication Principles

We believe words matter. Whether spoken, written, or shared online, how we express ourselves shapes our community. Therefore, we commit to:

- **Speaking with courage and consistency**: We don’t say anything online we wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
- **Being mindful that our words reflect who we are**: Every message represents our values.
- **Taking the time to express ourselves clearly and carefully**: Good communication takes thought.
- **Listening before speaking**: No one has all the answers. We stay open to other perspectives.
- **Using language as a bridge**: We aim to connect, not divide.
- **Considering the impact of what we share**: Words have consequences — large and small.
- **Sharing responsibly**: We share content only after reading, understanding, and considering its relevance and tone.
- **Focusing on ideas, not individuals**: Disagreement is welcome, but personal attacks are not.
- **Rejecting insults as arguments**: Aggression weakens our message.
- **Recognizing that silence can be powerful**: Sometimes, choosing not to speak is the wisest action.

These principles are rooted in mutual respect and a shared commitment to building trust, empathy, and understanding in everything we do.

  - Deliberate misgendering or deadnaming

## ⚖️ Power Dynamics

We acknowledge that power imbalances exist — across roles, disciplines, and experience levels. Leadership, expertise, or seniority **should never be used to silence, belittle, or exclude others**.

Those in positions of authority are expected to set the tone for the community — not just by their actions, but by their words and the space they create for others to contribute safely.

We especially value the voices of junior and early-career members, and we reaffirm that everyone’s input and growth matter equally.

All reports will be handled discreetly and seriously. We will:

- Investigate incidents fairly and promptly  
- Prioritize the safety, dignity, and privacy of those involved  
- Take corrective actions where appropriate, including temporary or permanent removal  

We will **never tolerate retaliation** against individuals who report in good faith or assist with investigations.
