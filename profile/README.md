Welcome to the **cloe-org** GitHub organization!

We are a group of cosmologists, primarily members of the Euclid Consortium and other large-scale structure collaborations, dedicated to advancing cosmological statistical inference. Our main focus is on developing open-source software that enables the comparison of theoretical models with diverse cosmological datasets to derive robust statistical constraints. While our work is strongly motivated by the scientific goals of the Euclid mission, our tools and methods are designed to be broadly applicable across current and future cosmological experiments.

Our team previously contributed to the development of **CLOE** (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid). Building on the expertise gained from that experience, we are now developing a new generation of CLOE-inspired software aimed at maximizing the scientific return of upcoming cosmological surveys. Our goal is to facilitate a seamless interface between theoretical predictions and data analysis, fostering accessibility and collaboration within the broader cosmology community.
